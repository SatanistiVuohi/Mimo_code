So as I have explained, the 'brokencode.py' -file does not have 'index += 1' nested under 'while' loop, so it begins to ramp up the memory usage gradually until reaching 100% and then dropping down and ramping up, rinse and repeat. And then 'workingcode.py' has the line of code and it works as intented. I am now very  intrigued why it does this.
